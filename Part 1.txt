3. approximatelyEqual
This snippet checks whether two numbers are approximately equal to each other, with a small difference.

This snippet splits values into two groups and then puts a truthy element of filter in the first group, and in the second group otherwise.
You can use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.push() to add elements to groups based on filter.

10. bifurcateBy
This snippet splits values into two groups, based on a predicate function. If the predicate function returns a truthy value, the element will be placed in the first group. Otherwise, it will be placed in the second group.
You can use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.push() to add elements to groups, based on the value returned by fn for each element.

11. bottomVisible
